# **App Name**: Elastic Canvas

## Core Features:

- 3D Scroll Animation: Animated 3D model of a keychain or patch that reacts to the user's scrolling, creating a cinematic experience. The models and animations react to the scroll in creative and unexpected ways to produce the feeling of elasticity.
- Bilingual Support: Full support for both Arabic and English, including text direction switching (RTL for Arabic, LTR for English) and language toggle in the header.
- Portfolio Gallery: Interactive gallery of previous projects with animated hover previews and optional 3D thumbnails.
- Contact Form: Contact form with real-time submission stored in Firestore, smooth input transitions, and validation. Submissions are analyzed by an LLM tool that detects the sentiment of the submission. A notification is created if a negative submission is received.
- Admin Interface: Optional Firebase Authentication for admin access to update portfolio entries dynamically, as well as the home page configuration and analytics.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon orange (#FF9933), chosen for its energetic and futuristic feel, in line with the brand's creative offerings. It stands out against the dark background, and is inspired by the vivid hues found in artistic work.
- Background color: Dark gradient (#121212), providing a modern and minimal canvas that highlights the 3D models and animations, inspired by the elegance requested by the prompt.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), used for interactive elements and highlights to draw attention and complement the neon orange, maintaining a futuristic aesthetic.
- Logo Colors: Incorporate the logo's light blue (#ADD8E6) and darker blue (#4682B4) as secondary accent colors to maintain brand consistency.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif with a precise, contemporary, fashionable, avant-garde look, excellent for short texts, which is what we are going for in an animated site; body text: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality, that fits nicely with the design.
- Minimalist icons for services and navigation, using simple shapes and line art with the neon orange accent color. The logo uses a star shape and the word 'elastic' in a rounded sans-serif font.
- Full-screen layout with smooth transitions and parallax effects to create an immersive user experience.
- Cinematic and fluid animations for page transitions, hover effects, and content reveals (fade, slide, zoom, parallax).
